              <p>
                Weld Neck Flange is flanges that designed to be joined to a
                piping system by butt welding. This kind of flange include lots
                of specification. Weld Neck Flange is expensive because of its
                long neck and cost of people for contact WN flange with pipeline
                or fitting but is preferred for high-stress applications. The
                necks, or hubs, transmits stresses to the pipeline. The gradual
                transition of thickness from the base of the hub to the wall
                thickness at the butt weld provides important reinforcement of
                the Weld Neck Flange. The bore of Weld-Neck flange matches bore
                of the pipeline, reducing turbulence and erosion.
